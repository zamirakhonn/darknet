YOLOv7 is more accurate and faster than YOLOv5 by 120% FPS, than YOLOX by 180% FPS, than Dual-Swin-T by 1200% FPS, than ConvNext by 550% FPS, than SWIN-L by 500% FPS, than PPYOLOE-X by 150% FPS.

YOLOv7 surpasses all known object detectors in both speed and accuracy in the range from 5 FPS to 160 FPS and has the highest accuracy 56.8% AP among all known real-time object detectors with 30 FPS or higher on GPU V100, batch=1.

YOLOv7-e6 (55.9% AP, 56 FPS V100 b=1) by +500% FPS faster than SWIN-L C-M-RCNN (53.9% AP, 9.2 FPS A100 b=1)
YOLOv7-e6 (55.9% AP, 56 FPS V100 b=1) by +550% FPS faster than ConvNeXt-XL C-M-RCNN (55.2% AP, 8.6 FPS A100 b=1)
YOLOv7-w6 (54.6% AP, 84 FPS V100 b=1) by +120% FPS faster than YOLOv5-X6-r6.1 (55.0% AP, 38 FPS V100 b=1)
YOLOv7-w6 (54.6% AP, 84 FPS V100 b=1) by +1200% FPS faster than Dual-Swin-T C-M-RCNN (53.6% AP, 6.5 FPS V100 b=1)
YOLOv7x (52.9% AP, 114 FPS V100 b=1) by +150% FPS faster than PPYOLOE-X (51.9% AP, 45 FPS V100 b=1)
YOLOv7 (51.2% AP, 161 FPS V100 b=1) by +180% FPS faster than YOLOX-X (51.1% AP, 58 FPS V100 b=1)
